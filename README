# explore_overtone

Just exploring overtone and taking some notes.  Mainly for me to be
able to come back & figure this out if I ever get distracted by other
things.

But, I might change that once I figure out what I'm doing here.

# How I got here

Started at http://overtone.github.com/ and it pointed me to the wiki
for Documentation.  Starting there, it really wasn't obvious that I
didn't need to get Clojure and also the clone the overtone git
repository first.  Turns out, neither of those were necessary, but it
wasn't clear since instructions were scattered across several pages.
After the fact, I noticed that the main github overtone README.md
has what I needed to do:

1. get lein from http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
   
    make executable & get on your path, then
    $ lein

2. use lein to get all the bits you need for the tutorial

    $ lein new explore_overtone
    $ cd explore_overtone
    $ lein deps

3. bring up the repl
    $ lein repl
    ...
    (System/exit 0)

4. but, I wasn't satisfied with that...need Emacs.

    https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Overtone-in-Emacs
      add swank-clojure
      https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure
        add clojure-mode.el
        http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode
      got live-coding-emacs config
        $ git clone https://github.com/overtone/live-coding-emacs.git
        $ mv .emacs.d/ .emacs.d.old
        $ cp -R .../live-coding-emacs .emacs.d

Startup in emacs

Option 1:
  $ cd .../explore_overtone
  $ lein swank

  In emacs
  ;; initially wasn't able to get this to work...
  ;; oh, see "connecting with slime" in the swank-clojure page, 
  M-x slime-connect
  (use 'overtone.live)
  ...
  (System/exit 0)

Option 2:
  In emacs
  go to explore_overtone dir in dired
  M-x clojure-jack-in
  (use 'overtone.live)
  ...
  (System/exit 0)

# Results so far...

* Monotron clone

  Makes somewhat interesting electronic beeps and also can be
  controlled via TouchOSC iPad/Android App.

* Guitar

# Questions & Answers

Q & A about the environment below.  For questions that can be answered
with code, see
https://github.com/rogerallen/explore_overtone/blob/master/src/explore_overtone/qna.clj

I'll write down questions as I think of them.  Answers as I get to them.

* where to understand the basics of Clojure?

  http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+for+Beginners

  Nice intro for me:
  http://moxleystratton.com/clojure/clojure-tutorial-for-the-non-lisp-programmer

  Looks like a nice, more detailed resource:
  http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html

* where to understand the basics of emacs+clojure/slime-mode?

  http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started+with+Emacs
  http://www.cliki.net/SLIME%20Features

* how do I eval code from another buffer into the repl buffer?

  C-x C-e evaluates & prints out the results into the message area.
  Nothing happens in the repl buffer, but the evaluation does happen.

  M-x slime-eval-region

* how do I get a standalone SuperCollider for server mode?

  overtone.live is fine to start with, but eventually you'll want
  more/better ugens.

  download from http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/
  1) main app -- install normally
  2) extra plugins -- apparently on the mac it goes to...
     ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/

* other resources to look at:

  Impromptu?

  Found this http://impromptu.moso.com.au/tutorials.html 
  what's the difference?

  Haskell School of Music
