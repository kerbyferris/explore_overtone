If I haven't installed SuperCollider to run a standalone server, is this expected behavior?

> lein repl

^^^ this is the warning I'm curious about...is it expected?

I can do simple oscillators

user=> (demo 2 (sin-osc))
28
user=> (demo 2 (square))
28

and I hear the difference, but when I do

user=> (demo 2 (stk-pluck))
exception in GraphDef_Recv: UGen 'StkPluck' not installed.
28

Ah, now that I do this from a 'lein repl' I see this clear error, but what confused me here is that if I use emacs, I don't see that exception message. 
Is that expected?  Or do I need to look closer at my emacs setup?  I seem to get "stdout", but not "stderr".
